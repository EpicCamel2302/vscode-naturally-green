# Features

A theme made of deep greens, made to be easy on the eyes while maintaining clarity. Syntax is pastelle and flowery, contrasted against green hues that bring nature right into your code editor.

- Dark, crunchy greens for all UI elements
- Pastelle syntax highlighting that pops without being an eyesore
- A colour palette inspired by flora of the woodland floor

> Note:  This theme makes use of italics and bold font styles to better add clarity to certain elements. Make sure you're using a font that supports these features well to avoid issues with text rendering.
